This winter we’re working to reduce plastic pollution. Single-use plastic clogs our landfills and pollutes our waterways, and companies that should be leading in plastic reduction aren't taking responsibility for the waste they produce. So, MassPIRG is calling on Whole Foods to eliminate its single-use plastic packaging. Whole Foods was once an industry leader in plastic reduction, but they recently got an F in a report for their waste policies. If we want to get serious about reducing single-use plastic, corporations have to do their part, and Whole Foods should help lead the way. Whole Foods could reclaim its leadership in sustainability and spark other national grocers to follow suit. In the Boston area alone, a coastal city, there are over 20 Whole Foods. Pressure locally could lead to nationwide reforms. The only way to protect our waterways and wildlife is to “turn off the tap” of plastic production, and pursue alternatives. We are asking Whole Foods to take the first step, and reduce their plastic packaging by 25% by the year 2025. We can make a difference, and that’s why we’re hiring staff to build support in communities.

opening for civil rights worker / community organizer / volunteer coordinator



	Part time fundraising position with 8 hour shifts, 5 hours field, 3 hours getting to & from turf & paperwork. 7 days a week. 3pm -11pm, extra shifts available weekends 10 am -6 pm, paying at $15 - $ 18 hour. Rain or Shine. First 3 training days are unpaid. This is a canvassing/field organizing position. This job requires training other new hires and combines a number of different positions, including 1) the skills of a civil rights worker, communicating about the legislation we are hoping to pass before Congress. 2) The abilities of a volunteer coordinator, asking if voters are ready, willing and able to volunteer on the campaign. In addition, this position requires 3) the skills of a community organizer, knocking on doors to build grassroots support and membership for the organization. This job requires fundraising, specifically targeting the right dollar amount for voters. For example, college students will be asked for modest contributions, while senior citizens who are retired will be asked for more generous contributions. You will ask voters the focusing question, whether they are “with us on the issue,” in order to encourage them to sign up. As a field organizer for our cause, you will petition Congress for passage of legislation, register voters, recruit volunteers, educate the public and protect civil rights. Further, your job will include collecting signatures, print names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mails and asking if voters are interested in working for or volunteering for our campaign and if they can like us on facebook. You will be asking voters if they are interested in hosting house parties or holding fundraisers, are willing to host phone banks, accepting their fellow voters in to their homes and collecting information as described above. Light map reading skills required.  

	Change for Progress is campaigning, challenging convention in calling attention to injustice wherever it lies. Local in scope, national in orientation. We seek passage of the Freedom to Vote Act S.2747, co-sponsored by Angus King of Maine, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Chuck Schumer of New York, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Joe Manchin of W. Virginia, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Alex Padilla of California and Jon Tester of Montana. This legislation will create AVR, allowing for automatic registration to vote when Americans get their driver’s licenses. If this legislation is enacted into law Americans will have to opt out of registering to vote instead of opt in. This legislation amends the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 the “motor voter law,” signed by President Clinton. This legislation would make Election Day a National Holiday. In addition, it would nationalize same day voter registration so that Americans, friends and new neighbors everywhere could register to vote on Election Day so they can cast a ballot. Finally, this legislation would create weeklong early voting so that congregations in the Black South could take their “Souls to the Polls,” and vote after Church on Sunday.”

	We seek idealist self-starters who are outgoing and political. There is no previous experience required for this job. Ideal for college students looking to supplant their income with part time work. Our work is a great resume builder, a good reference for future positions, an ideal position to receive good recommendations leading to political work in Boston or in Washington DC. This job enables you to get a toe hold in politics and is critical to developing the skills necessary for a successful position in politics. Ideal for senior citizens, stay at home mom’s and dad’s and activists of all stripes. Must have legible hand writing. You must be vaccinated against the coronavirus or CO VID 19 virus in order to work at this position as you will be going from door to door and interacting with the public. In addition, you must have received the booster shot and carry with you at all times the Department of Health and Human Services Center for Disease Control Card in order to confirm with us that you have received the vaccine. Must wear a mask while canvassing. We must keep our voters and workers safe. This protects you, importantly and protects us. Send resume’s with 3 references contact information that include telephone numbers and e-mail addresses to info@changeforprogress.com. For questions call 443 909 9342 ask for Ari.

This winter we’re working to reduce plastic pollution. Single-use plastic clogs our landfills and pollutes our waterways, and companies that should be leading in plastic reduction aren't taking responsibility for the waste they produce. So, MassPIRG is calling on Whole Foods to eliminate its single-use plastic packaging. Whole Foods was once an industry leader in plastic reduction, but they recently got an F in a report for their waste policies. If we want to get serious about reducing single-use plastic, corporations have to do their part, and Whole Foods should help lead the way. Whole Foods could reclaim its leadership in sustainability and spark other national grocers to follow suit. In the Boston area alone, a coastal city, there are over 20 Whole Foods. Pressure locally could lead to nationwide reforms. The only way to protect our waterways and wildlife is to “turn off the tap” of plastic production, and pursue alternatives. We are asking Whole Foods to take the first step, and reduce their plastic packaging by 25% by the year 2025. We can make a difference, and that’s why we’re hiring staff to build support in communities.

Our volunteers and guests are of diverse backgrounds and life experiences. Many of the people we volunteer with and serve face issues related to substance abuse, homelessness, mental health, unemployment, and poverty. We are searching for a Community Resource Specialist to support the members of our community with the various situations they are in.

The Community Resource Specialist will link guests and/or members of Brighton Allston Congregational Church to resources related to but not limited to finding employment, housing or medical assistance. This position requires you to have a deep understanding of the challenges faced by those living in poverty, extensive knowledge of local resources designed for assistance, as well as compassionate communication skills. This is not a counseling role, although the Community Resource Specialist will need to have patience and understanding when working with clients as well as support clients in completing paperwork if they are unable to read or write in English. The Community Resource Specialist will also be asked to work with our team on special projects related to things like staff and volunteer training and grant writing.

Bilingual candidates preferred in any of the following languages: Cantonese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish

Degrees Required: Bachelor's Degree Required, Masters Preferred

Fields of Study: Psychology, Social Work, Sociology, Human Resources

Salary: $20/hr

Hours: 13 hours per week, including Wednesdays from 4pm-6pm and the 2nd and 4th Saturdays of the month from 9am-1pm. Additional hours by mutual agreement of the Community Resource Specialist and Pastor. Hours will vary according to the needs of our target community and the Pastor’s discretion.

Our church, and by extension our food ministry, is committed to the work of justice, equity, and inclusion. We recognize that systemic injustice often plays out in employment practices. We particularly encourage those whose identities have been historically marginalized (Black, Indigenous, POC, woman, queer, trans, disabled, unhoused, etc.) to apply. 

Our buildings have two flights of stairs and no elevator. Staff must be able to occasionally lift, carry, and move items up to 30lbs. Offices are on the second floor of the building.

About Brighton Allston Congregational Church

Our church is a small, progressive congregation (United Church of Christ) that actively welcomes LGBTQ+ members, with a strong commitment to racial and environmental justice. Through our ministries, we provide food relief to thousands in Allston-Brighton. As such, we have been designated as an “essential service” and remain open during the pandemic crisis. All of our staff and guests are required to wear masks on the property and follow other COVID safety protocols. Vaccination is required for staff.

BACC is committed to food justice. Our campus hosts a community refrigerator that is open to all 24/7. For the last 40 years, we have served a Community Supper every Wednesday that is free and open to all. Thanks to our food rescue partners, we are able to share bags of fruit, vegetables, breads, and desserts weekly, in addition to the hot meal. We also host a food pantry distribution twice a month on Saturdays. 

Our staff works very closely as a team. Beyond the basic requirements of each position, we are looking for a team player with good communication skills, who can get behind our mission of serving all members of our community equitably. All of our staff are expected to greet our guests with warmth and compassion. 

To apply, please send your resume, cover letter, and two references to pastornikira@gmail.com by January 28th.
