      "This winter we’re working to reduce plastic pollution. Single-use plastic clogs our landfills and pollutes our waterways, and companies that should be leading in plastic reduction aren't taking responsibility for the waste they produce. So, MassPIRG is calling on Whole Foods to eliminate its single-use plastic packaging. Whole Foods was once an industry leader in plastic reduction, but they recently got an F in a report for their waste policies. If we want to get serious about reducing single-use plastic, corporations have to do their part, and Whole Foods should help lead the way. Whole Foods could reclaim its leadership in sustainability and spark other national grocers to follow suit. In the Boston area alone, a coastal city, there are over 20 Whole Foods. Pressure locally could lead to nationwide reforms. The only way to protect our waterways and wildlife is to “turn off the tap” of plastic production, and pursue alternatives. We are asking Whole Foods to take the first step, and reduce their plastic packaging by 25% by the year 2025. We can make a difference, and that’s why we’re hiring staff to build support in communities.\n",

This job requires training other new hires and combines a number of different positions, including 1) the skills of a civil rights worker, communicating about the legislation we are hoping to pass before Congress. 2) The abilities of a volunteer coordinator, asking if voters are ready, willing and able to volunteer on the campaign.

This job requires fundraising, specifically targeting the right dollar amount for voters. For example, college students will be asked for modest contributions, while senior citizens who are retired will be asked for more generous contributions. You will ask voters the focusing question, whether they are “with us on the issue,” in order to encourage them to sign up. As a field organizer for our cause, you will petition Congress for passage of legislation, register voters, recruit volunteers, educate the public and protect civil rights. Further, your job will include collecting signatures, print names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mails and asking if voters are interested in working for or volunteering for our campaign and if they can like us on facebook.

Virginia, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Alex Padilla of California and Jon Tester of Montana. This legislation will create AVR, allowing for automatic registration to vote when Americans get their driver’s licenses. If this legislation is enacted into law Americans will have to opt out of registering to vote instead of opt in. This legislation amends the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 the “motor voter law,” signed by President Clinton. This legislation would make Election Day a National Holiday. In addition, it would nationalize same day voter registration so that Americans, friends and new neighbors everywhere could register to vote on Election Day so they can cast a ballot. Finally, this legislation would create weeklong early voting so that congregations in the Black South could take their “Souls to the Polls,” and vote after Church on Sunday.”\n",

      "This winter we’re working to reduce plastic pollution. Single-use plastic clogs our landfills and pollutes our waterways, and companies that should be leading in plastic reduction aren't taking responsibility for the waste they produce. So, MassPIRG is calling on Whole Foods to eliminate its single-use plastic packaging. Whole Foods was once an industry leader in plastic reduction, but they recently got an F in a report for their waste policies. If we want to get serious about reducing single-use plastic, corporations have to do their part, and Whole Foods should help lead the way. Whole Foods could reclaim its leadership in sustainability and spark other national grocers to follow suit. In the Boston area alone, a coastal city, there are over 20 Whole Foods. Pressure locally could lead to nationwide reforms. The only way to protect our waterways and wildlife is to “turn off the tap” of plastic production, and pursue alternatives. We are asking Whole Foods to take the first step, and reduce their plastic packaging by 25% by the year 2025. We can make a difference, and that’s why we’re hiring staff to build support in communities.\n",
